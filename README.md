### Official Launch
**balangkas** is finally here. This is a student-first app designed to work like a **digital bulletin board**. Instead of using messy spreadsheets or hard-to-read calendars, subjects are pinned like sticky notes to keep everything organized and easy to see.

This app was built to help students manage their time better, whether they are checking their next class in the hallway or planning their week at home.

### What's New (v1.0.1)
- **Dark Mode Support:** A new dark theme is now available, making it more comfortable to view your schedule in low-light environments.
- **Organized Board Layout:** We’ve updated the display to a clean, vertical stack. Each subject card is now a consistent size (180px), giving your board a perfectly uniform and organized look no matter your schedule.
- **Smarter Links:** Long links or URLs are now automatically shortened to keep your cards tidy. These links also now match the color of your note’s text for a more seamless and polished design.
- **Typing Helpers:** A new floating notification will appear if you reach the character limit while typing, helping you keep your subject details concise and perfectly fitted.
- **Better Image Saves:** When you save your board as an image, it now includes your custom board title and automatically matches your chosen theme (Light or Dark).

### Features
- **Bulletin Board Layout:** The schedule is presented as a board where every subject card is organized and balanced for a clean, uniform look.
- **Link Support:** Subject notes support links for **Google Meet** or **Zoom**. URLs are automatically shortened and match your note’s text color so the layout never breaks.
- **Download as Image:** A built-in exporter saves the board as a high-quality PNG, now featuring custom board titles and theme support (Light/Dark).
- **Cloud Sync and Offline Mode:** Data is saved to the cloud so it stays the same on both phone and laptop. The app also works without an internet connection.

### Technical Details
- **PWA Integration:** The app can be installed directly to a phone home screen without using an app store.
- **Firebase Backend:** Uses Firestore for real-time syncing and Firebase Hosting for fast loading.
- **Security:** The core logic is obfuscated to protect the inner workings of the app while it is public on GitHub.
